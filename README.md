## 🚀 Why Suraksha AI?

Sanitation workers regularly face:

- ☠️ Toxic gas exposure  
- 💨 Oxygen-deficient confined spaces  
- 🌡️ Extreme heat conditions  
- ❤️ Physical overexertion  
- ⚠️ Hazardous underground environments  

Traditional safety systems react **after** an incident.  
**Suraksha AI predicts, prevents, and protects — in real time.**

# ✨ Core Features

## 🔮 Real-Time Hazard Prediction

Suraksha AI analyzes live sensor data from workers and environments:

- ☢️ Gas levels (H₂S, CO, CH₄, O₂)  
- ❤️ Heart rate & biometric signals  
- 🌡️ Ambient temperature  
- 📍 GPS/location tracking  
- ⚡ Activity & movement data  

Using advanced AI models, the system predicts:

- Suffocation risk  
- Toxic exposure  
- Heat stroke  
- Cardiac stress  
- Confined-space hazards  

> ⚠️ Detect dangers *before* they escalate into emergencies.

## 🤖 AI Safety Assistant (Supervisor Copilot)

An intelligent conversational interface enabling supervisors to:

- Query worker safety status  
- Understand real-time risk factors  
- Receive AI-recommended mitigation actions  
- Investigate anomaly trends  
- Review historical safety data  

Example queries:
- "Who is currently at highest risk?"
- "Why is Worker 17’s risk score elevated?"
- "Show workers exposed to high methane levels today."


It acts as a real-time decision-support copilot for command centers.

## 📊 AI-Driven Dynamic Risk Scoring

Each worker is assigned a continuously updated **Risk Score** based on:

- Environmental exposure levels  
- Physiological strain indicators  
- Real-time hazard patterns  
- Historical safety trends  
- Reinforcement learning models trained using sanitation expert knowledge  

### Risk Levels:
- 🟢 Low Risk  
- 🟡 Moderate Risk  
- 🔴 Critical Risk  

Supervisors instantly know **who needs attention first**.

## 🧠 Automated Incident Explanations

When a hazardous event is detected, Suraksha AI automatically generates:

- 📌 Root cause analysis  
- 📈 Severity classification  
- ⚠️ Immediate action steps  
- 🛠 Recommended mitigation strategy  

Clear, structured explanations reduce response confusion and improve reaction time.

---

## 🔁 Proactive Safety Recommendations

Beyond real-time alerts, Suraksha AI continuously learns from:

- Recurring environmental risk patterns  
- Worker fatigue cycles  
- High-risk time windows  
- Seasonal hazard variations  

It recommends:

- Shift adjustments  
- Protective gear enhancements  
- Work rotation strategies  
- Environmental safety improvements  

> Safety improves continuously with every new data point.
