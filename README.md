# **App Name**: Suraksha AI

## Core Features:

- Real-time Hazard Prediction: Utilize the Gemini API to analyze real-time sensor data from sanitation workers (gas levels, heart rate, location, temperature) and predict potential hazards like suffocation, exposure to toxins, and heat stroke before they occur.
- AI Safety Assistant: Provide a chatbot interface powered by Gemini that allows supervisors to query worker safety status, understand risk factors, and receive recommended actions for any anomalies detected. The tool will access aggregated, anonymized worker data to identify risks.
- Automated Incident Explanations: Upon detection of a hazardous event, automatically generate a detailed explanation using Gemini, outlining the cause of the danger, severity level, and recommended immediate actions.
- AI-Driven Risk Scoring: Assign a dynamic risk score to each sanitation worker based on real-time data analysis via Gemini, providing a clear, prioritized view of who is at the highest risk.
- Proactive Safety Recommendations: Provide suggestions powered by Gemini based on trend analysis of field-gathered data to avert any possible incident using best practice approaches. The tool is powered by reinforcement learning using sanitation expert experience.
- Interactive Dashboard: Visualize real-time worker data, risk scores, hazard predictions, and alerts in a user-friendly dashboard inspired by mission control interfaces. Prioritizes clear communication of critical information to command center supervisors.
- Emergency Alert System: Trigger immediate alerts via the platform based on critical incidents or risk factors. Supports supervisor initiated actions as well.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep cerulean (#2F80ED), conveying trust and technological prowess, complemented by the safety and precision the application provides. Avoid teal.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#E5E9F2), a desaturated shade of the primary color, to create a professional, distraction-free backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft coral (#F26419), an analogous color to cerulean but shifted for contrast, to draw attention to crucial alerts and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif, for clear, easily readable headlines; body font: 'Inter', for a neutral and accessible body.
- Use minimalist, easily recognizable icons in a consistent style to represent different data points and actions, making use of universally understood safety symbols where relevant.
- Adopt a grid-based layout for the dashboard to maintain order and clarity, with clearly defined sections for worker monitoring, risk scores, and AI assistant chat.
- Incorporate subtle animations for data updates and alert notifications, drawing the user's eye to important changes without causing unnecessary distraction.
